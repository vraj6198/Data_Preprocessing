Importing the libraries -> 

numpy: for using arrays
Matplotlib : for plotting charts and graphs
pandas : not only import the dataset but create the matrix of features and dependent variable vector

Importing the dataset ->

load the dataset file -> train a machine learning model -> add feature and dependent variable

feature are columns that are going to be predict and the dependent variable. 
the dependent variable is last column

iloc function: locate index of columns

When to apply feature scaling, before or after splitting the dataset into the training set and test set ?
Answer: after the splitting the dataset into the training set and test set

splitting the dataset into the training set and test set: On training set: train the machine learning model on existing observations
and On test set: Evaluate the performance of your model on new observations

Not apply Feature Scaling before dataset splitting because the split is to prevent information leakage on the test set, which not supposed to have until the training is done

Feature Scaling: 

There are two type: Normalization and standardisation

Normalization: It is recommended when you have normal distribution in most of your features.
Standardisation: It works well all the time, it will do the job all the time
